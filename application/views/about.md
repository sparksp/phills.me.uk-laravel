<h2>Developer, Cuttlefish Multimedia Ltd <small>2005 - Present</small></h2>

<div class="row"><div class="offset2 span10">
	<p>My work with Cuttlefish started as a holiday job to develop an interactive questionnaire tool for The Jitty to enable young people to gather views and opinions online. Since then I have worked a further two holiday placements and took an industrial year to further develop my skills. Using CSS, HTML, JavaScript, MySQL and HTML I have worked on a number of Social Network sites, a Borough-­‐wide events calendar website and a property finder.</p>

	<p>The property finder allows visitors to find information about their home including their waste collection dates, council tax band, any local planning applications and other useful information. The information is gathered from various sources, including the Borough Council’s Geographical Information System (GIS) After completing my degree, in August 2009 I joined the Cuttlefish team full time.</p>

<h2>Leicestershire Youth Democracy <small>2001 - 2011</small></h2>

<div class="row"><div class="offset2 span10">
	<p>From 2001 through 2011 I was heavily involved in Youth Democracy in Leicestershire through voluntary work with the County Youth Council for Leicestershire (CYCLe) and Connexions Leicester Shire’s Youth Executive.</p>

	<h3>Connexions Leicester Shire</h3>

	<p>My main role was to attend Partnership Board and Local Management Committee meetings and provide a young person’s perspective on the operations of the company. Within 2 years I became a member of the Grants Panel, reviewing applications from youth lead projects for funding and later developing a process to involve a small group of young people in the review process.</p>

	<h3>County Youth Council, Leicestershire</h3>

	<p>CYCLe started off from the UK Youth Parliament elections in 2001.  We established a group of young people from schools and youth groups around the county to consult and advise.  Over the years CYCLe has grown into a full Pyramid of Participation involving 7 Youth Councils at the Borough / District level all linking up into CYCLe and down into School Council.  My role in the youth councils developed into building and maintaining a portal on <a href="http://www.thejitty.com/">The Jitty</a> to advertise the youth councils and host their calendar and meeting notes.</p>
